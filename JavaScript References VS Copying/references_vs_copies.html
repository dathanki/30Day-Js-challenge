    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age; // a reference
      console.log(age, age2);
      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2);

      let name = 'Guy';
      let name2 = name; // another reference
      console.log(name, name2);
      name = 'Guy Fiery';
      console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Guy', 'Vase', 'Gregor', 'Lumens'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice(); // copy  whole array because slice is left empty
    const team3 = [].concat(players);  // append all the array values of original array into new one
    const team4 = [...players]; // es6 spread method, it will take all elements of original array and spread evenly in new array
    const team5 = Array.from(players);  // just return each element from the iterable array 
    team2[3] = 'Lux'; 

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Rob Nurgundy',
      age: 50
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; // this will change orginal object because it is making a reference to original

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    /* object assign will create a new (blank) object from an existing one with the option to modify/add existing/additional elements */
    const cap2 = Object.assign([], person, {number: 99});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

//    const cap3 = {...person}; // doing this is very shallow as it will only copy one level deep

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const Guy_Fieri = { // create an object with some data 
      name: 'Megas_XLR',
      age: 37,
      social: {
        twiiter: '@nocontxtmegas',
        facebook: 'Megas-XLR-237693366289159'
      }
    };

    //console.clear();
    console.log(Guy_Fieri);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, Guy_Fieri);  // create a copy of the object by passing in object we want to duplicate

   /* pass an element of type object through JSON.stringify to make it a string and back to an object using JSON.parse */
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(Guy_Fieri));
